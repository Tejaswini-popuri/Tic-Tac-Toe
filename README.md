# Tic-Tac-Toe
Create a simple tic-tac-toe game using JavaFX application
The output window has the following
elements and working:
- The title ‘TicTacToe’.
- The output window is a grid of 3 squares by 3 squares.
- The bar at the bottom of the window indicates whether it’s X’s or O’s turn. (O and X are the two players here).
- The first player(X) starts with marking a cross on one of the nine empty squares.
- The second player(O) can mark an O on any one of the empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. (see below for example).
- After a player wins, indicate who has won in the bar at the bottom of the window (as shown in the last output example below).
- If all 9 squares are full without a winner, the game is over and results in a tie which should be indicated at the bottom.
